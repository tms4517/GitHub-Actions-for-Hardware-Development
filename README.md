This repository contains a collection of commonly used GitHub Actions that
serve as status checks in RTL development.

Status checks in GitHub Actions serve several important purposes:
1. Code Quality: Linters and other static analysis tools enforce coding
standards and detect potential issues before a commit is pushed to master.
2. Automated Testing: Ensure that your code passes all tests before it is
merged. This helps maintain code quality and prevents bugs from being
introduced.
